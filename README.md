# Project Goal
To empower Canadian prairie farmers and agronomists with data-driven insights from on-farm precision experimentation (OFPE). This initiative aims to use precision agriculture technology to optimize profit and resource use efficiency for wheat and barley through determining optimal seed and nitrogen rates based on within-farm, local, and regional datasets.
